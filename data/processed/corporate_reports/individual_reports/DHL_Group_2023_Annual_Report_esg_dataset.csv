"The Company Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Further Information 225 DHL Group  2023 Annual Report Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023.",410,ONT_045,Financial_Inclusion,Environmental,Financial_Inclusion,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,financial,1,DHL-Group-2023-Annual-Report.pdf
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.

"Recoverability of goodwill a) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, goodwill amounting to EUR 13.1 billion is reported under the balance sheet item Intangible assets, representing about 20 of total assets and 57 of the Groups reported equity.",289,ONT_045,Financial_Inclusion,Environmental,Financial_Inclusion,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,financial,1,DHL-Group-2023-Annual-Report.pdf
Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company at least once a year for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements regardless of whether there are external or internal indications that the assets may be impaired. The impairment test is based on a calculation model in which the planned future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital using a discounted cash flow method.,411,ONT_045,Financial_Inclusion,Environmental,Financial_Inclusion,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,financial,1,DHL-Group-2023-Annual-Report.pdf
The planned future cash flows are derived from the executive directors adopted middle-term planning and the supervisory boards approved budget planning. The result of this measurement depends to a large extent on the assumptions made by the executive directors for the determination of future cash flows and the determination of the parameters for the discount rates used and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty.,425,ONT_020,Board_Diversity,Environmental,Board_Diversity,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,board,1,DHL-Group-2023-Annual-Report.pdf
