"The levers involved in achieving this commitment can be categorized as follows:  Optimization of crop protection volumes required per hectare through tools such as:  Precision application: data-driven tools that ensure the right amount of crop protection product is applied by farmers in the right place and at the right time  Seed treatment: seed-applied crop protection tools that can significantly reduce the volume of chemicals used and therefore the potential exposure of wildlife and the environment to these chemicals  Seeds and traits: crops bred and designed to better fight pests and diseases that attack them, ensuring less chemical crop protection is needed  Biologics: complementing chemical crop protection with biologics to enhance integrated management practices and reduce pest resistance  Reduction of the environmental impact of the crop pro- tection product itself:  Better environmental profile of an active ingredient (lower effect on nontarget plants and species) com- pared to other products  Reduction of the emissions into the environment:  Mitigation measures such as drift reduction and buffer strips  Digitally enabled precision application Based on a 2021 data set covering global crop protection use data, Bayers crop protection products represent around 2 of the global environmental impact of all crop protection products, despite Bayers market share in terms of sales being significantly higher (around 18 of the global crop protection market).",1478,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.5,2,"environmental, emissions",1,bayer-sustainability-report-2023.pdf

"Over the subsequent months the water level must remain constant to ensure that the plants establish and grow. Shortly before the harvest (after 90 to 130 days), the farmer drains the field to enable the grain to mature.
