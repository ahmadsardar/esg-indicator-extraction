"3 Purpose Introduction The challenge of climate change and E.ONs role Air temperatures on earth have been rising since the industrial revolution, and 2023 was the warmest year on record. Climate change and the accelerating increase of GHG emissions is one of humanitys biggest challenges. Since the preindustrial period, atmospheric CO2 has risen from about 280 parts per million (ppm) to more than 422 ppm.1 The air now contains more CO2 than at any time in the last three million years.",488,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Global warming causes sea level rise and extreme weather, including heat waves and severe floods. Plants and animals are at risk of losing their habi- tats, endangering many species and thus accelerating the loss of biodiversity.

"Our remaining generating capacity mainly consists of smaller gas- or biofuel-fired cogeneration plants that supply our district heating networks or that are embedded at customers premises, typically under lease arrangements. Since 2018, E.ONs installed generating capacity has declined by 95 percent. This has significantly affected our carbon intensity and other generation-related KPIs to the degree that theyre no longer material for our ESG reporting.",455,ONT_039,Customer_Relationship,Environmental,Customer_Relationship,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,customer,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Our annual reports therefore contain less such data. However, this information remains relevant for ESG ratings and analysts. We therefore publish additional information in the KPI Appendix. As a result of these developments, our decarbonization path is no longer affected primarily by our own large-scale generation business but by the power we procure and then sell to customers. Nearly all of these emissions are upstream of us. We want the power we buy to be increas- ingly green.",484,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Green power as a proportion of our total power sales is therefore a key sustainability figure. E.ON is predominantly a distribution system operator. In fact, were Europes largest. Consequently, E.ON isnt a large-scale renewable power producer. Instead, we deliver the green energy that such producers generate, thereby helping decarbonize our customers.",353,ONT_003,Energy,Environmental,Energy,ONTOLOGY,0.3333333333333333,1,energy,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"In addition, our energy solutions businesses install and operate smaller-scale renewables facilities  typically solar systems  for B2B customers to help them reduce the size of their carbon footprint. Depending on the contract type or financing option, a solar system we install may be owned by us or the customer. Its often part of a package that includes other energy solutions like an embedded low-carbon cogeneration unit or electric-vehicle charging stations.",464,ONT_003,Energy,Environmental,Energy,ONTOLOGY,0.3333333333333333,1,energy,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"The legacy assets of companies that E.ON has acquired include small renewable power facilities. They arent part of our core business, which is to develop our distribution networks and energy solutions businesses in ways that accelerate Europes energy transition. In conclusion, the comparability of E.ONs generation-related GHG data with those of typical power generation companies is very limited.",398,ONT_003,Energy,Environmental,Energy,ONTOLOGY,0.3333333333333333,1,energy,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"For example, emissions from our power and heat generation assets accounted for just 2.4 percent of our total emissions in 2023. Digitalization The rapid growth of renewables and the accelerating electrification of the mobility and heat sectors are making Europes energy system much more decentralized and complex. In addition, Europes energy sector is evolving at an unprecedented pace.

"It articulates our focus dimensions: climate action, people, and good corporate governance. Our company is committed to being a climate leader and to setting ambitious climate targets. Weve taken a variety of steps to reduce our direct and indirect emissions. This chapter presents them for each source of GHG. Carbon emissions and targets Carbon emissions The baseline year for our group-wide climate targets is 2019. It thus includes the innogy businesses we acquired that year.",480,ONT_038,Corporate_Governance,Environmental,Corporate_Governance,ONTOLOGY,0.4,2,"governance, corporate",1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Understanding the amount and sources of our emissions better enables us to find ways to reduce them. We therefore broke down our carbon emissions for 2019 by the main drivers. This shows the significance of individual GHG sources and their share of the E.ON Groups total carbon emissions across all three scopes. Scope 1 are direct GHG emissions from fuels combusted in sources that we own or control, such as our power and heat plants and vehicle fleet.",454,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"They also include fugitive methane emissions from our gas distribution networks. Scope 2 are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of electricity that we purchase to power our buildings, operations, and electric vehicles or that are classified as line losses in our power distribution networks. These emissions dont physically occur at our facilities but rather at the facility where the electricity is generated.",418,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
This is why power distribution losses are classified as Scope 2 emissions but gas distribution losses as Scope 1 emissions. Emissions attributable to line losses are lower in grid segments with lots of renewables feed-in. Scope 3 are indirect emissions that occur upstream and downstream from E.ON. They result primarily from the generation of the electricity we purchase and resell to end-customers and the use of the gas that weve sold to them.,446,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"But also included are the emissions attributable to the production and provision of the goods and services we purchase. Since 2019, Scope 3 emissions from purchased power resold to end-customers have accounted for more than half of E.ONs Scope 3 emissions. We intend to progressively reduce these emissions as well. In 2022 the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated our climate targets, including those for our Scope 3 emissions from purchased power.",462,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Just four GHG categories were responsible for about 95 percent of E.ONs total emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) in 2019: purchased power sold to customers, combustion of natural gas sold to customers, power distribution losses, and purchased goods and services. These are indirect Scope 3 emissions and partly Scope 2 emissions. The main drivers of our emissions are therefore the power and natural gas we sell to customers.",416,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Two GHG categories accounted for 98 percent of our direct emissions (Scope 1): power and heat generation and fugitive emissions. Achieving E.ONs climate targets will thus involve addressing our main drivers. Climate targets To be climate-neutral means producing close to zero emissions and offsetting remaining residual emissions that cannot be eliminated. As stated above, in 2022 the SBTi validated that E.ONs climate targets are in line with the Paris Climate Agreements 1.5 degree target.",492,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"8 Climate strategy This means that E.ONs planned emission reductions will help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees compared with pre-industrial levels. To this end, we plan to reduce our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared with a 2019 baseline (absolute target).",294,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Despite having limited control over our total wheeling volume, which also includes volume for non-E.ON customers, we aim to reduce the emissions related to energy we distribute to any consumer by 42 percent. In addition, we intend to reduce the Scope 3 emissions from purchased power resold to end-customers by 75 percent per kWh (intensity target).

"Appendix and Disclaimer 40 Appendix and Disclaimer Other atmospheric emissions Fossil-fueled power plants emit nitric oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and dust. As stated in the section The role of power generation at E.ON, large-scale power generation is no longer a core E.ON business. We therefore no longer consider NOx, SO2, and dust emissions as environmental KPIs. They occur mostly at small-scale gas-fired CHP plants and some larger plants that supply our district heat networks.",490,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.5,2,"environmental, emissions",1,EON_2024_On_course_for_net_zero.pdf
"Dust: efficient filters ensure that we no longer have significant emissions. Increased use of biomass will lead to a slight increase, but total dust emissions will remain low. Nitric oxide (NOx): we expect selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce NOx emissions in our larger plants by 50 to 75 percent by 2030 (versus 2019).
