"Many urgent issues continued to dominate the agenda: inflation, supply chain issues, the wars in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas.

"The geopolitical environment, marked by conflict, reinforces our conviction that comprehensive risk management is a fundamental prerequisite for Deutsche Banks success.

"Many of these topics are rarely discussed in public or have been somewhat overlooked recently in view of the other major challenges. This applies in particular to the topic of sustainability. It made fewer headlines in 2023, even though, according to NASA research, last year was the warmest since records began, with droughts and floods on a scale rarely seen before.",368,,GHGEmissionsScope1,Environmental,Climate Change,,0.125,1,topics,1,Non-Financial-Report-2023.pdf
This underscores just how critical the fight against climate change and environmental destruction is and how it deserves the full attention not only of society at large but also of our bank. We are convinced that the transformation to a sustainable economy must be accelerated. And we see it as an imperative for a global bank headquartered in Europe to position ourselves as a credible leader. The term sustainability goes far beyond protecting our environment and the climate.,478,ONT_037,Community_and_Society,Environmental,Community_and_Society,ONTOLOGY,0.4,2,"society, environmental",1,Non-Financial-Report-2023.pdf
Another element that plays into our long-term business success is when we also systematically address the threats posed by human rights being violated or by financial crime  and when we act accordingly. The non-financial risks associated with these threats are an integral part of our risk management nowadays. And we work hard to improve and tighten our controls.,364,ONT_021,Human_Rights,Environmental,Human_Rights,ONTOLOGY,0.4,2,"rights, human",1,Non-Financial-Report-2023.pdf

"We continue to work towards our  500 billion target by the end of 2025, despite the recent slow-down in growth in sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes on account of reduced demand by corporates and private clients as they faced uncertain market conditions. We expect this downward trend to be temporary as environmental risks materialize more frequently and the regulatory and reporting environment reinforces the trend towards sustainable financing and ESG investments in the medium term.",501,ONT_038,Corporate_Governance,Environmental,Corporate_Governance,ONTOLOGY,0.4,2,"corporate, environmental",1,Non-Financial-Report-2023.pdf

We held a Fighting Financial Crime week that saw strong employee participation and a range of experts from both outside the bank and from senior management.
