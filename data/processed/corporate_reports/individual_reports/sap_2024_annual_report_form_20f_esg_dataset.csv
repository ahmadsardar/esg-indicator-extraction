"Cloud revenue recognition As discussed in note A.1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generated revenue in 2024 of EUR 34,176 million, of which EUR 17,141 million relates to cloud revenues from fees earned from providing customers a cloud offering with software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service andor premium cloud support through subscriptions for use of the Companys cloud solutions.",436,ONT_039,Customer_Relationship,Environmental,Customer_Relationship,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,customer,1,sap-2024-annual-report-form-20f.pdf

"However, some cloud business models are provisioned on a consumption basis where a customer commits to a fixed value of spend on cloud services throughout the contract term, but with the discretion to call off cloud services on an as needed basis. For those arrangements cloud revenue is recognized based on consumption as it best reflects the measure towards satisfaction of the performance obligation(s).

The principal considerations that led to the determination are the complex auditor judgments required to evaluate: (1) whether certain agreements with the same customer were economically linked and need to be combined; (2) whether the various services that are owed by the Company according to the contract qualified as separate performance obligations; (3) the allocation of the transaction price of a customer contract to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone-selling prices; and (4) the point in time at which the provision of services by the Company for the specific performance obligation commences.,630,ONT_039,Customer_Relationship,Environmental,Customer_Relationship,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,customer,1,sap-2024-annual-report-form-20f.pdf

"Typically, our standardized support offerings and our professional service offerings follow this approach.

"This SSP considers overall pricing objectives, taking market conditions and other factors into account.

"As SAPs go-to-market strategies evolve further, SAP continuously monitors its commercial models and pricing practices, which could result in changes to our SSPs in the future. For offerings for which we cannot justify a range and we observe highly variable pricing, and for which we lack substantial direct costs to estimate based on a cost-plus-margin approach, we allocate the transaction price by applying a residual approach.",429,ONT_046,Labor_Practices,Environmental,Labor_Practices,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,practices,1,sap-2024-annual-report-form-20f.pdf
"The SSPs of material right options depend on the probability of option exercise. In estimating these probabilities, we apply judgment considering historical exercise patterns.
