Boards oversight Bayer AG is subject to German stock corporation law and therefore has a dual governance system consist- ing of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management manages the com- pany based on a strategy that is geared toward its long-term success.

Bayer considers climate protection and the related reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be a top priority. We support the Paris Agreement and the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 C relative to the pre- industrial level.

"We anticipate that our business areas of healthcare and agriculture will on the one hand be impacted by climate change, but on the other will also be part of the solution.

Climate-related risks are already accounted for in our Group-wide enterprise risk management (ERM) system. 2.2 Climate scenarios We analyze the possible effects of climate change across two different scenarios. We use these scenarios to understand the impact of climate change on our business and to identify measures for mitigating risks and leveraging opportunities.,368,ONT_034,Climate_Risk_Mgmt.,Environmental,Climate_Risk_Mgmt.,ONTOLOGY,0.2857142857142857,2,"climate, risk",1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf
"With a cross-functional, cross-divisional team, we have identified relevant opportu- nities and risks for our business in both scenarios. We have based our scenario descriptions on Assessment Report 6 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and supplementing this with further sources relevant to our business areas.",332,ONT_034,Climate_Risk_Mgmt.,Environmental,Climate_Risk_Mgmt.,ONTOLOGY,0.2857142857142857,2,"climate, risk",1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf
"The basis comprises the optimistic climate change scenario envisaging warming of below 2 C  the Green Road SSP1-1.9, which equates to the fulfillment of the climate goals of the Paris Agreement (temperature increase of 1.4 C by 2100 compared with the preindustrial age)  and a scenario that reflects current global behavior  the Rocky Road SSP3-7.0 (temperature increase of 3.6 C).

"Both scenarios (Green Road and Rocky Road) are important for assessing Bayers climate-related risks, and we will therefore continue to analyze both scenarios in detail. We once again adjusted our Green Road scenario in 2023 based on external requirements.

"Between 2081 and 2100, the temperature is likely to have risen by 1.4 C compared with the preindustrial age. This scenario is marked by the rapid implementation of ambitious and globally coordinated climate-related laws and rules that can also include transformational requirements and new regulations for companies in the short term. The rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions leads to less severe weather- and climate-related effects.",441,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf
"In 2023, we changed our Green Road scenario from SSP1-2.6 to SSP1-1.9, to be in line with requirements from the TCFD. This did not result in any relevant changes to our risks and opportu- nities analysis. Rocky Road (SSP3-7.0)  The Rocky Road scenario assumes the rise in average global temperature compared with the preindustrial age to be around 2.1 C by between 2041 and 2060, and probably 3.6 C by between 2081 and 2100.",424,ONT_024,Green_Buildings,Environmental,Green_Buildings,ONTOLOGY,0.2,1,green,1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf
"In this scenario, we expect less ambitious laws and provisions that vary widely from one region to another. That will lead to a slower pace of emissions reduction and thus more intensive weather- and climate-related changes in all regions of the world. The varying levels of ambition also lead to additional trade barriers that can be manifested in measures such as a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).",410,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf
"In our analysis of the effects of climate change, we go beyond the customary enterprise risk management time horizons and instead apply the following time horizons:  Short-term (20232025)  Medium-term (20262035)  Long-term (20362050) In 2023, we further developed our own agricultural climate model to analyze impacts on agricultural productivity in relation to the different scenarios.",386,ONT_034,Climate_Risk_Mgmt.,Environmental,Climate_Risk_Mgmt.,ONTOLOGY,0.2857142857142857,2,"climate, risk",1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf

"Transition impact drivers Based on the Paris Agreement, the most important countries and regions in which Bayer operates have committed to limiting global warming by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. One example is the European Unions Green Deal, the goal of which is to accelerate the transition to an emissions-free future and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Consequently, the EU is expected to further increase costs for the emission of greenhouse gases (e.g.",473,ONT_015,GHG_Emissions,Environmental,GHG_Emissions,ONTOLOGY,0.25,1,emissions,1,bayer-tcfd-report-2023.pdf

"We continuously analyze the further effects of regulatory changes on our business. National and international CO2 reduction targets could lead to the abandonment of fossil fuels and impact the demand for fuels from biomass (biofuels), for example.
