# ESG Indicators Extracted from Ontology Analysis

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive analysis of the ESG ontology (`esgontology.owl`) to extract all available ESG indicators and concepts for the thesis on "Context-Aware ESG Information Extraction from Corporate Reports using Domain-Specific Language Models".

## Analysis Results

### Total Indicators Found: 51
- **Performance Indicators**: 2 (explicit)
- **Maturity Indicators**: 0 (explicit)

7. ESG_Incentives
8. Environmental_Mgmt._System
9. Environmental_Policy
10. Financial_Inclusion
11. Privacy_and_IT

## Key Relationships Found

1. **Energy impacts SDG7** - Energy consumption relates to Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)
2. **Waste impacts SDG12** - Waste management relates to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)

## External References

The ontology imports from:
- **UN SDG Ontology**: `http://metadata.un.org/sdg/ontology`
  - Provides SDG Goal mappings
  - Links ESG indicators to specific Sustainable Development Goals

## Ontology Structure Analysis

### Object Properties
The ontology defines several key relationships:
- `belongsToCategory` - Links performance indicators to categories
- `influencesIndicator` - Shows indicator relationships
- `impacts` - Links concepts to SDGs
- `hasTarget` - Associates concepts with specific targets
- `consumesEnergy`, `consumesWater`, `generatesWaste` - Operational relationships

### Class Hierarchy
The ontology follows a structured approach:
- **PerformanceIndicator** - Measurable ESG metrics
- **MaturityIndicator** - Assessment of ESG maturity levels
- **Category** - Grouping of related indicators
- **ESG Domain Classes** - Specific ESG areas (Environmental, Social, Governance)

## Implications for Thesis Research

### 1. Ontology-Driven Fine-Tuning
The 51 indicators provide a comprehensive foundation for:
- Training data annotation guidelines
- Context-aware model development
- Domain-specific vocabulary expansion

### 2. Hierarchical Indicator Structure
The categorization enables:
- Multi-level classification approaches
- Contextual understanding of indicator relationships
- Improved model performance through structured learning

### 3. SDG Alignment
The SDG mappings support:
- Global sustainability framework integration
- Cross-domain indicator validation
- Enhanced model interpretability

### 4. Semantic Relationships
The object properties enable:
- Relationship-aware extraction
- Context propagation in language models
- Improved accuracy through semantic understanding

## Recommendations for Model Development

1. **Use all 51 indicators** as the comprehensive target set for fine-tuning
2. **Leverage hierarchical structure** for multi-task learning approaches
3. **Incorporate SDG mappings** for enhanced context understanding
4. **Utilize semantic relationships** for improved extraction accuracy
5. **Focus on the 2 explicit indicators** as primary validation targets

## Data Sources for Additional Indicators

While the ontology provides 51 core indicators, the thesis also incorporates:
- **GRI Standards**: 46 comprehensive indicators from Global Reporting Initiative
- **SASB Standards**: Industry-specific indicators from Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
- **TCFD Framework**: Climate-related financial disclosures

This multi-source approach ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining ontology-driven focus.
