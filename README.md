## Research Questions
1. How effectively can domain-adapted LLMs extract numerical ESG indicators from corporate reports?
2. What is the performance difference across Environmental, Social, and Governance categories?
3. How does ontology-guided training improve extraction accuracy compared to baseline methods?

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Manual annotation of ESG indicators in corporate reports
2. **Model Selection**: Fine-tune FinBERT for ESG-specific Named Entity Recognition
3. **Training**: Domain adaptation using annotated ESG indicators
4. **Evaluation**: Performance comparison against baseline methods

## ESG Indicators Framework
**Comprehensive Indicator Set**: 46 indicators across three categories

### Environmental (18 indicators)
- GHG Emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3), Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy Usage
- Water Usage, Waste Reduction, Biodiversity Impact, Carbon Footprint
- Environmental Compliance, Green Innovation, Resource Efficiency
- Climate Risk Assessment, Pollution Control, Sustainable Supply Chain
- Environmental Management Systems, Land Use, Circular Economy

### Social (16 indicators)
- Employee Diversity, Health & Safety, Training & Development
- Human Rights, Community Impact, Customer Satisfaction
- Labor Relations, Fair Wages, Work-Life Balance
- Product Safety, Social Innovation, Stakeholder Engagement
- Data Privacy, Supply Chain Labor, Accessibility, Local Employment

### Governance (12 indicators)
- Board Composition, Executive Compensation, Audit Quality
- Risk Management, Ethics & Compliance, Transparency
- Shareholder Rights, Cybersecurity, Anti-Corruption
- Regulatory Compliance, Stakeholder Governance, Business Ethics

**Sources**: GRI Standards, SASB Framework, TCFD Recommendations, EU Taxonomy, UN SDGs, Original Ontology

## Timeline (6 Weeks)
- **Week 1**: Literature review, ontology analysis, and ESG framework expansion âœ…
